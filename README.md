mc-pair-miners
==============

Lua scripts for pair mining turtles. This set of scripts is intended to provide an easy to deploy, automated pair mining system.

Currently aiming to improve state persistence across OS reloads (chunk loading issues) and desynchronisation recovery (relative movement issues).
